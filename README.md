# REPscan
Scan list of de novo mutations against input gappedPeak or broadPeak files from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (REP). Focus of the code base here is the identification of de novo mutations in regulatory regions that are active in development. As such, data used in example scripts will be primarily adult or fetal brain histone marks and DNAse hypersensitivity.
